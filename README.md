# Intelligent Computer Systems

This repository contains the code for the Intelligent Computer Systems course at the [University of Rzeszów](https://www.ur.edu.pl/en/home).

## Problem definition

**Graph colouring problem**: Given a graph G = (V, E) and a number of colours k, find a way to colour the vertices of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices have the same colour. The problem is NP-complete.

## Requirements

1. Implementation of a solution to the problem using the genetic algorithm.
2. Documentation (report) as described in [template](http://bartoszj.prz-rzeszow.pl/ICS/)

## PyGAD

[PyGAD](https://pygad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python library for implementing Genetic Algorithms (GAs) and Genetic Programming (GP). It is a lightweight library with a simple API. PyGAD is designed to be used in machine learning and data science applications.
